# Rainy Days

**Frame 1:** Sad girl  
**Frame 2:** Funny guy trying to make her laugh  
**Frame 3:** Girl thinking "something is wrong with me"  
**Frame 4:** Girl at door looking at rain outside  
**Frame 5:** Girl walking outside with umbrella and looking at kids playing in rain  

Sometimes when we are sad  
Nothing seems to make us feel better  
"Something is wrong with me"  
"Something is wrong with her" is all you can hear  
Sometimes emotions are like weather,  
Sometimes all you can do on a rainy day, is take an umbrella with you
