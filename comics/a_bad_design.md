# A Bad Design

**Frame 1:** Multiple people all connected by a physical fleshy "wire". Wires coming from one side are little red  
**Frame 2:** A man crying in middle with red wires coming out of him  
**Frame 3:** All come around him.  
**Frame 4:** A man reading newspaper surrounded by "bad things". Stronger man killing weaker man.  
**Frame 5:** News article showing war deaths.  
**Frame 6:** Looks at delicious food on the table.  
**Frame 7:** Eats fast and with hunger.  
**Frame 5:** People loving their kids, worshiped as pure.  
**Frame 6:** Sleeps with newspaper on him "Evolution: Origins"  

Why is that we are not connected to each other.  
Why don't we feel the pain of one, feel it like our own.  
We crush the weak, to make ourself stronger.  
Depend on the instincts bestowed by evolution, a legacy of rampages and rape.  
Instinct built around wanting to survive as an individual, not as a species.  
Maybe one day, we will value consciousness over our instincts,  
See them as a beast's urge than a God's gift.  
Maybe we will see that we are born impure, and that evolution is bad. A bad design.
